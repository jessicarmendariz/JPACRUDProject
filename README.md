# JPACRUDProject
### Overview
"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies."

Kristen Ashley is a New York Times Bestselling Author - famous for multiple contemporary romance and fantasy book series. Beautiful Books is a website dedicated to tracking the books she has published, books the website user has read, and a database for keeping track of the Book Title, Heroine, Hero, Description, Series, and a Rating.

### How To Use
Opening the website the user is prompted with two choices: Search Book or Create A Book. Choosing Search Book the user can choose to Search by Book Id or Search by Book Title. Choosing Create A Book, the user is prompted with multiple data fields to fill out in order to Create a Book in the database. Once a book is searched, or created, the user is able to update the information of the book, or to delete the book.

### Building JPACRUDProject
For the JPACRUDProject, multiple technologies were used:
- Methods
- Lists
- Arrays
- Classes
- Objects
- Loops
- CRUD
- Java
- MySQL
- Spring Boot

Problem: Throughout the development of this applicaiton, syntax was a huge struggle. Creating .jsp files and mapping their path to the right place has been a consistant issue of mine. Continuity and eye for detail has been a reoccuring issue in the building of this JPACRUDProject. 

Solution: Having a second set of eyes review your work - especially to point out "ID here is a capital "I" and over here it is a lowercase "i". Other than having a proofreader help find the errors, creating a record of standard operating procedures is the best way to keep continuity in the way parameters are written.
